# Game Pack

This repo holds one of my school projects, the game pack.

The game pack is a collection of 3 games, available through the menu.py script, although they can be run individually if needed.

The games are:

* Maze Game
* Guessing Game
* Quiz Game

readme.rtf explains how to add questions to the quiz game.
